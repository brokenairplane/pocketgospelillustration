      <h1>Materials</h1>
      <p>A limited number of pre-assembled packages are available to <a href="https://store.andrekole.org/shop/illustration/pocket-gospel-illustration/">order from Andre Kole Productions</a>.</p>
      <div>
        <strong>Beads</strong>
        <p>25 mm with 10mm hole (1" with 3/8" hole) Round Wood Macrame Beads. We recommend the Natural and the Maple colors together.
          Any wood beads need to be smoothed out on the inside so they slide smoothly on the cord without snagging. This can be done
          by running them over a drill bit just under the size of the hole or a round file that is spinning in a drill.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Cord></strong>
        <p>We use 1/8" Neon Turquoise (Turquoise and Sea Blue are also good colors), cut to 36" with a hot knife type of tool to
          prevent unraveling. Then after threading the beads on, tie three knots on top of each other in each end.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Keychain Cross></strong>
        <p>We recommend one which has no potentially distracting inscription.</p>

        <p>The key to this illustration is to convincingly tie a knot which dissolves when the ends are pulled. Learn the move from
          the video or from the image below (courtesy granted from Mark Wilson, source is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mark-Wilsons-Complete-Course-Magic/dp/0762414553">Mark Wilson Complete Course in Magic</a>)</p>

      <h1>Presentation</h1>
      <p>Practice what you are going to say. Knowing what you are going to say ahead of time is a big confidence booster and reduces
        one of the greatest psychological barriers against sharing your faith. Nonetheless, pray and trust the Holy Spirit to speak
        through you.</p>
      <p>Preset the cross where it will be easy to get. Such as an otherwise empty pocket; or if wearing a shirt with a pocket, hook
        the chain over an ink pen with the cross hanging out of sight inside the pocket.</p>
      <p>Before doing this illustration the subject of conversation should already be about spiritual things. You could initiate this
        by asking questions like "Have you ever wondered about what will happen to you after you die?" or "Who do you think Jesus
        is?" After listening to their response, you can then ask "Do you mind if I share a three minute illustration that explains
        what I have found to be the truth about our relationship with God?" Assuming they indicate interest, proceed with the
        following presentation.</p>

            left hand. The ends of the cord should be held by the remaining three curled fingers of each hand. The bulk of the cord

            three days later. He then appeared to His closest friends and to over 500 others. These events, and others, in Jesus'
            life confirm that He is the Son of God, Who paid the penalty for our sins,…</td>
          <td>Place both ends of the cord in the left hand, with the right end sticking up about an inch higher. With the right hand
            get the cross and display it. Then place the loop of chain over the protruding end of cord, and briefly take the right
            end of the cord in the right hand, allowing the chain to drop down to the bead. Take both ends back in the left hand
            again, and with the free hand slip the loop of chain over the nearest bead, so it is on the knot. Take one end of the
            cord in each hand, showing the cross hanging between the beads.</td>
